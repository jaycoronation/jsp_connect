Born in Hisar, Haryana, on 9 March 1970, Naveen is the youngest child of the industrialist-philanthropist-politician Om Prakash Jindal and his wife Savitri. He studied at the Delhi Public School (Mathura Road), New Delhi, before graduating in Commerce from Hans Raj College, Delhi University, in 1990. He subsequently completed an MBA degree from the University of Texas at Dallas, in 1992. His penchant for leadership became evident during his student days. He was the President of the Student Government and recipient of the ‘Student Leader of the Year Award’ at the university. On his return to India, Naveen began managing his father’s political affairs. In 2004 he stood for elections from Kurukshetra on a Congress party ticket and won, beating his nearest rival Abhay Singh Chautala by 1.6 lakh votes. He repeated the feat in 2009. While Naveen is a two-time Member of Parliament from the Kurukshetra Lok Sabha constituency in Haryana, he is also the Chairman and Managing Director of Jindal Steel and Power Limited, which is a part of the $15 billion diversified O.P. Jindal Group. Naveen’s hard work and business acumen demands applause, for he has transformed the once moderately performing enterprise to the organisation that today operates as the world’s largest coal-based sponge iron manufacturing plant in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh, in addition to plants in Jharkhand and Odisha. He is also the Chairman of Jindal Power Limited, a subsidiary of JSPL, which runs the 1,000 MW O.P. Jindal Thermal Power Plant in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh – India’s first such 1,000 MW plant in the private sector. Going beyond his own constituency, Naveen has championed the causes of education, healthcare and the upliftment of weaker sections across Haryana, and in the vicinity of his factories in other parts of India. He has set up hospitals and schools, adopted villages and is an active campaigner for women’s empowerment, health and education. In 2011 Naveen added another feather in his cap by establishing the ‘Citizens’ Alliance for Reproductive Health and Rights’, an organisation that brings together politicians, media persons and NGOs in a bid to spread awareness about family planning, maternal and child mortality, and related issues. Naveen is a true social entrepreneur. He is a people person. He can effortlessly relate to thousands of other people, and is driven to help those who are in need. His numerous social initiatives have led to an overall improvement in the quality of life in all regions where he has business interests, and beyond. For those who may not know, Naveen is the man who is single-handedly responsible for making the Tiranga more accessible to the average citizen. His unrelenting legal and political campaign led to a revision of the Flag Code of India which now grants every private citizen the right to fly the Indian National Flag publicly with dignity and honour on all days of the year. The Flag Foundation of India that he founded along with his wife is an effort to foster respect for the Tiranga and the values it embodies among Indian youth. It is not surprising to learn that in 2011 his unrelenting support to his alma mater was recognised in a unique way, as the University of Texas at Dallas renamed its ‘School of Management’ as ‘The Naveen Jindal School of Management.’ A special acknowledgement for a special person indeed. He is also an international level shooting champion who has represented India on numerous national and international platforms including the Asian Games. Naveen is also an avid polo player. Naveen’s mother is currently a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly from Hisar and is the Chairperson Emeritus of Jindal Steel and Power Limited and JSW Steel. He has eight siblings: sisters Saroj Bhartia, Nirmala Goel, Urmila Bhuwalka, Sarika Jhunjhunwala and Seema Jajodia; and brothers Prithviraj, Sajjan and Rattan Jindal who are also industrialists. Naveen is married to accomplished Kuchipudi dancer Shallu Jindal. The couple has a son and a daughter and they live in Delhi and Kurukshetra. Naveen Jindal is a charismatic, dynamic, and a down-to-earth human being who lives life intensely. He is sincerely determined to reach out to the masses and bring about a positive change in the lives of those he touches."},{"title":"Inspiration","top_txt":"Born on August 7, 1930 in Nalwa village, in Haryana’s Hisar district, O.P.

He was a three-time MLA from Haryana (1991, 2000 and 2005), and also the first Indian industrialist to become a Lok Sabha MP. He was also the state’s serving Power Minister at the time of his death. O.P. Jindal passed away on March 31, 2005, at the age of 75, leaving in his wake a mantra of economic progress with a social purpose. He bequeathed to his son Naveen a belief in self-reliance in business, as also a conviction that the betterment of business sans the betterment of the people is pointless and unsustainable.

I could have… but I did not. Because I realised that there was no point in joining the chorus of complaints from the citizenry about the systemic problems we encounter, unless I was willing to do something about it. And there was no point in feeling pain at the poverty and inequality I saw around me, if I did nothing beyond shrugging these off as inevitabilities inherent in the Indian reality. Gandhi said: Be the change you want to see in the world. In the heat and dust of politics, I have found a means to do just that. India is blessed with a wealth of human talent and natural resources. But too many children out there are working when they should be studying, too few adults know how to even write their names, too many women are denied the right to choose when to marry and when to have babies, and too many men refuse to take responsibility for birth control. These are facts that should make us hang our heads in shame as the world looks towards us as a potential superpower.","image":"","bottom_txt":"Politics is my way of making a difference… in my constituency – Kurukshetra, in my home state – Haryana, and right across this great nation that I love.

And one day along with the rest of today’s youth, I hope to look back and say with satisfaction that I did not just dream of a great India, but that I worked hard to build the India of my dreams!

A regular attendee at all sessions, his powerful speeches and interventions in the House have raised issues that are of significance at the national and local level.","image":"http://naveenjindal.com/wp-content/uploads/Parliament-300x225.jpg","bottom_txt":"Over the years he has been a voice of the people of Haryana – and in particular Kurukshetra – in the Lower House, raising questions about development activities in his constituency including the Kaithal railway bridge, Shahbad-Thol railway over-bridge, a railway over-bridge at Yamuna Nagar, a four-lane-highway from Yamuna Nagar to Pehowa and trauma centres at Yamuna Nagar and Kurukshetra. Naveen has carried his passion for the National Flag into the Parliament complex. Following his repeated efforts, on February 18, 2010, the Rules Committee of the Lok Sabha accepted his proposal to allow MPs display the Tricolour as a lapel pin while seated in the House. The Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Lok Sabha, did not permit the MPs to wear badges of any kind while seated in the House. An exception has now been made for the ‘Tiranga’. His sustained 3-year effort led to the Central Government making Indian currency acceptable at Duty Free Shops at all international airports in the country. This was a no mean achievement. On August 21, 2002, Naveen wrote a letter to the then NDA government’s Minister of Tourism and Culture articulating his concerns about the non-acceptance of Indian currency within India at the Duty Free Shops run by the Indian Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC), even though FEMA rules permit an Indian resident to carry up to Rs 5,000 while travelling abroad. Over a period of three years (during which time the Congress party came back to power with the UPA), Naveen had to pursue the matter with the Ministry, ITDC and the Reserve Bank of India. Considering the issues of national pride at stake, he finally took up the matter with then Finance Minister P. Chidambaram. In early 2005, the Centre at last decided to make Indian currency acceptable at Duty Free Shops at international airports in India. For more information on Parliamentary Committees click here."}]}]
